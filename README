What is this?

This is a tool for people who want to pick Major League Baseball stadiums that expose them to a wide range of experiences.

One way to do that is to visit the stadium that is the top favored under given dimension/factor filters. 
That's what this tool helps you do. 

Just pick your favourite team and which stadiums you've visited from the dropdowns on the right of the map, Then choose the factors/dimensions that you care about and watch the recommendations roll in.

Blue indicates the stadium for your home country.
Green indicates the stadiums you have been to. 
Red indicates the recommendation on the stadiums you could visit based on your filters. 
The top recommendation will always be indicated with a marker. 

Click on any of the stadiums to see it's underlying data. Try changing up your dimension selections to see how recommendations change.


How does it work?

Recommendations are generated by finding the stadiums that have a fairly high score in the filters inputted.
